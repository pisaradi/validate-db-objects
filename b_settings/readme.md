### JSON File Content

- "snowflake_object_definition.json" serves as a template, outlining the following general rules to filling the JSON file.
- The JSON file:
  - must begin with "{" and end with "}",
  - must contain correctly placed brackets, commas and quotation marks, and other elements, \
    as no validation is provided to assist the user.
  - Any main object name (the 1<sup>st</sup> level after "{") in the same JSON file:
    - can be any name chosen by the user,
    - can appear any number of times,
    - can contain almost any character in its name,
    - must be unique in the file.
- For better readability:
  - empty rows can be inserted between sections as needed,
  - it's recommended to place corresponding opening and closing brackets:
    - either on the same row with the text or nothing in between, or
    - on separate rows with the text indented in the following row.
- The table below explains the significance of sections under the main objects' names.
  - Text enclosed in \|\| does not represent actual options. \
    Instead, it indicates that the user must determine the appropriate text based on all information provided in the corresponding table row.
